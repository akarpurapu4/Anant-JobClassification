# JobClassification
#### As part of my summer internship at [Anant Corporation](https://anant.us/), I trained a classifier to categorize job listings into one of seven categories: Interface Technical Architect, Business Analyst, Software Technical Architect, System Technical Architect, Project Manager, Database Technical Architect, and Miscellaneous.
#### There are a couple of options to run the code:
* Create a Wolfram Account and use [Wolfram|One Cloud](https://www.wolframcloud.com/)* 
* Create a Wolfram Account and download [Wolfram|One Desktop](https://www.wolfram.com/desktop/)*
* Download [Wolfram Player](https://www.wolfram.com/player/)
#### *If you would like to modify the code, please make sure to follow one of these options.
